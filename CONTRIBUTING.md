# Notes to Admins

In order to publish a new version of the action, simply update the "version" in the package.json and merge into the main branch.

The workflow at ./github/workflows/publish.yml will apply the new version in the form of tags, which is all that is needed to publish an Action.

Example of tags applied:

- Let's say that the new version you have applied is `1.2.3`.
- The commit will be tagged with `v1.2.3` as you would expect, but it will also be tagged with `v1.2` and `v1`. This is so that we are effectively moving the "head" of these major and minor versions up to the latest patch release which is relevant to them, meaning users can have workflows which specify only `v1` or `v1.2` and always be ensured that they are receiving the latest and greatest.
